This is a command line tool to install ~OCaml~ and ~opam~ on your
machine. 

Install and run with it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ npm install install_ocaml -g
$ install_ocaml
#+END_SRC

Yay, now you the OCaml compilers ~ocamlc~, ~ocamlopt~ and the repl
~ocaml~ installed on your system. You also have ~opam~, OCaml's
package manager installed.

Be sure to read my [[http://hyegar.com/blog/2015/10/19/so-you're-learning-ocaml/][blog post]] that will get you up to speed on
everything OCaml including the build systems, jargon and things you
can do.

* Fun Facts!
~install_ocaml~ was written in OCaml, in code.ml, and compiled to
JavaScript with ~js_of_ocaml~.
